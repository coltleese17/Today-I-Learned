# Tilde Notation

An Approximation notation for estimating algorithmic running time (or memory) as a function of inpute size N.

Ignore lower order terms for 2 reasons
* when N is large, terms are negligble
* when N is small, we don't care

This drastically simplifies runtime estimation and works by focusing on the most expensive operation.
