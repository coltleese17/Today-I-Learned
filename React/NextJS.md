# Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that provides SSR, simplified routing and API routing, as well as additional lifecycle methods. It's more of page driven system design than create-react-app which is componenent driven.

Simply write React in pages/someFile.js or pages/somePath/[id].js and a route / dynamic route is created for that page. 

Write JS in pages/api/someFile.js and the file becomes and endpoint.

Seems to get productive really quickly with create-next-app
