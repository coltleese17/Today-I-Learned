# May 21st

Learned:
* Kadane's algorithm, a dp approach for finding max contigous subbarray, effectively you just save the current max for each subbaray as you traverse the list, and compare it to the global max each time.
* Priority Queues are implemented w/ binary heap and have log n insertion, max, and delMax() or delMin()
* Dutch National Flag / Array Partition: For these problems you simply set a boundary and swap and expand the boundary based off the pivot.
* Valid Parenthesis, stack implementation.

Practiced:
* Merge Two Lists / Merge K Lists
* Re order list

Tomorrow:
* Re-Practice Two Sum
* Solidify Kadanes, DNF, Valid Parentheses and Maximum Product Subarray, Merge K lists
* Learn "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters", 
* Learn "Sliding Window Using Two Pointers"
